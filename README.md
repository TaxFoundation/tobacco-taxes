To update the CPU-I data:

Data can be accessed here: https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=trueMake

Be sure to pick the right time frame (1955 to start) and include annual averages.

To convert the data for use in this tool, divide the current year's value by the value of each year. So 1955's converted value would be `current year / 1955 origina value`.
